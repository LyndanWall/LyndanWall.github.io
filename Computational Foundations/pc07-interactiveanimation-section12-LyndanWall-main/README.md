# PC07 - Interactive Animation (or simple game!)
This programming challenge will get you to flex your function skills and make your first (very basic) interactive art or game!<br>
Create a game where the user interacts with an animated element. The user can click on one or many patterns or shapes and have something happen. Or you can gamify the interaction, and have them click on elements in 30-60 seconds.<br>
**Think: Who is your user? What are they like? They are not you!!**

You may borrow code from this class or the internet, but you must cite it! Internet code can only account for 20% of your total script length. No more!

## In this repository
1. interactionExample.py - simple example demonstrating a click interaction and key press interaction. Read comments
2. img2gif.py - gif converter (changes any image to a .gif file. This .py file must be into the same folder as the image!!)
3. start_code.py - a few tweaks for click interactions added! 

### Work smart!
1. Build on past code, pseudocode, or ideas!<br>
2. [Use the docs!](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
3. Come up with an idea and then remove one element from it (keep it simple!)<br>
4. Keep checking the [easyExamples repo](https://github.com/ATLS1300/EasyExamples) for snippets and ideas!

**Note: If working with multiple patterns/shapes, I strongly recommend working with <= 3 turtles. Especially if you are new to programming or struggling with this concept!**

**Need inspo?**<br>
Try searching "interactive art", "simple game" or "click game" at [codepen.io](https://codepen.io)

## FOR FULL CREDIT YOUR CODE SHOULD:
1. Have a description at the top of the script with instructions/rules that describes inclusive practices that you have considered (color, speed, patterns, message, etc.)
    - If gamifying your interaction, your description should include rules of the game (how to win, etc.)
2. Have a shape or pattern that has some sort of movement (shrinking, randomly moving, wiggling, etc.)
3. Use at least one (1) callback function (onclick, on keypress, etc.)* to create user interaction
4. Create and call at least 1 function* that you have created (a function from PC06 is acceptable!)
    - This function **must** have at least 1 optional parameter!
5. Any and all unoriginal code (borrowed, found, etc) should be cited or it is **plagiarism**Â and you will get a 0 (at best)!

*No more than 20% code from outside class (intenet searches)*
*Examples given in class code DOES NOT COUNT. Create your own or modify the examples considerably.

### You should submit:
1. Pseudocode (by end of recitation, or 11:59pm for Grads)
2. Your script (.py) with the following name format: `PC06_interaction.py`
3. Any and all images used (.gif only!!)

### Resources:

Writing text with turtles (outside code, please cite!)

## Extra credit (Grads must complete 2):
    0.5 pts - (Game) Use the print statement to say if the user won or lost (use if statements)
    1 pt - Use and animate a list of turtles with a while loop.
    1 pt - Show your code to a friend (not in the class), and have them give you feedback (included in comments). They should comment on what they liked and what could be improved.
    1.5 pts - Make this for a target audience that has an identity you do not share. In the description, describe who this is for and how you adapted your interaction or game for them.
