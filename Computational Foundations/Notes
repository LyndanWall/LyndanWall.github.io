Computational Foundations Notes

variable = named data

    name = data     
    name = value 

        integer (int) = whole numbers, no decimal
        floats (float) = number with decimal
        string (str) = sequence of numbers/words surrounded by quotes (ex: "dog", "cat", "mouse"- single or double quotes)

syntax (grammer)= the rules that determine the order of symbols to be correctly understood by a language
